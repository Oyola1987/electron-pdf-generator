# App Electron to create pdf of consent

The first time it will generate a folder called `data` where the application will save the data it needs.

Another file will be created, this file called `dirdata.txt` contains the path where the `data` folder will be generated.

When `dirdata.txt` is changed, it is required to close and open the application.

By default, this folder `data` and file `dirdata.txt` will be generated in the same folder where the applicacion is running however you can edit this `dirdata.txt` file to change where the `data` folder will be created.
